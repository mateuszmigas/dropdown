# React dropdown

This project does not try to implement the ultimate dropdown that will solve all the problems because it's not possible. It provides a set of utilities for creating such dropdown with examples showing how to do so.

[Examples](https://codesandbox.io/s/agitated-saha-2pip8)

## Features

- controlled vs uncontrolled state - useDropdownState hook allows you to decide which part of the state you want to control. Check DropdownSimple vs DropdownControlledState
- redux-like state management - it exposes predefined actions and reducer. Both can be changed/extended
- VirtualizedList - a component that uses [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) with item memoization that will render only what's needed and reuse already rendered items
- VirtualizedLazyLoadingList - covers all the functionality of VirtualizedList but allows for lazy loading chunks of items. Uses: [react-window-infinite-loader](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window-infinite-loader)
- Customizable:
  - keyboard navigation
  - mouse navigation
  - focus management
